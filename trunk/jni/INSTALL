RockPlayer notes:
Following is method used by original FFmpeg. Which doesn't work with 
Android NDK yet.

Please use Android.mk to build the .so by standard Android NDK way.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Type './configure' to create the configuration. A list of configure
options is printed by running 'configure --help'.

'configure' can be launched from a directory different from the FFmpeg
sources to build the objects out of tree. To do this, use an absolute
path when launching 'configure', e.g. '/ffmpegdir/ffmpeg/configure'.

2) Then type 'make' to build FFmpeg. GNU Make 3.81 or later is required.

3) Type 'make install' to install all binaries and libraries you built.
